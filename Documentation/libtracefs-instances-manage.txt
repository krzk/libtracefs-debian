SYNOPSIS

*#include <tracefs.h>*

struct tracefs_instance pass:[*]*tracefs_instance_create*(const char pass:[*]_name_);
int *tracefs_instance_destroy*(struct tracefs_instance pass:[*]_instance_);
struct tracefs_instance pass:[*]*tracefs_instance_alloc*(const char pass:[*]_tracing_dir_, const char pass:[*]_name_);
void *tracefs_instance_free*(struct tracefs_instance pass:[*]_instance_);
bool *tracefs_instance_is_new*(struct tracefs_instance pass:[*]_instance_);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This set of functions can be used to manage trace instances. A trace
instance is a sub buffer used by the Linux tracing system. Given a unique
name, the events enabled in an instance do not affect the main tracing
system, nor other instances, as events enabled in the main tracing system
or other instances do not affect the given instance.

The _tracefs_instance_create()_ function allocates and initializes a new
tracefs_instance structure and returns it. If the instance with _name_ does
not yet exist in the system, it will be created. The _name_ could be NULL,
then the new tracefs_instance structure is initialised for the top instance.
Note that the top instance cannot be created in the system, if it does not
exist.

The _tracefs_instance_destroy()_ removes the instance from the system, but
does not free the structure. _tracefs_instance_free()__ must still be called
on _instance_.

The _tracefs_instance_alloc()_ function allocates a new tracefs_instance structure
for existing trace instance. If the instance does not exist in the system, the function
fails. The _tracing_dir_ parameter points to the system trace directory. It can be
NULL, then default system trace directory is used. This parameter is useful to allocate
instances to trace directories, copied from another machine. The _name_ is the name of
the instance, or NULL for the top instance in the given _tracing_dir_.

The _tracefs_instance_free()_ function frees the tracefs_instance structure,
without removing the trace instance from the system.

The _tracefs_instance_is_new()_ function checks if the given _instance_ is
newly created by _tracefs_instance_create()_, or it has been in the system
before that.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _tracefs_instance_create()_ and _tracefs_instance_alloc()_ functions return a pointer to
a newly allocated tracefs_instance structure. It must be freed with _tracefs_instance_free()_.

The _tracefs_instance_destroy()_ function returns 0 if it succeeds to remove
the instance, otherwise it returns -1 if the instance does not exist or it
fails to remove it.

The _tracefs_instance_is_new()_ function returns true if the
_tracefs_instance_create()_ that allocated _instance_ also created the
trace instance in the system, or false if the trace instance already
existed in the system when _instance_ was allocated by
_tracefs_instance_create()_ or _tracefs_instance_alloc()_.

EXAMPLE
-------
[source,c]
--
#include <tracefs.h>

struct tracefs_instance *inst = tracefs_instance_create("foo");
	if (!inst) {
		/* Error creating a new trace instance */
		...
	}

	...

	if (tracefs_instance_is_new(inst))
		tracefs_instance_destroy(inst);
	tracefs_instance_free(inst);
...

struct tracefs_instance *inst = tracefs_instance_alloc(NULL, "bar");
	if (!inst) {
		/* Error allocating 'bar' trace instance */
		...
	}

	...

	tracefs_instance_free(inst);
